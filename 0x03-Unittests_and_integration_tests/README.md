### Integration and Unit Testing

Here’s a quick overview of these testing concepts:

### 1. **Difference Between Unit and Integration Tests:**
   - **Unit Tests**:
     - Focus on testing small, isolated pieces of code, like individual functions or methods.
     - Aim to verify that each unit works correctly on its own, without dependencies on other components.
     - Fast to execute and help identify specific issues within a module.
   - **Integration Tests**:
     - Focus on testing how multiple components work together.
     - Verify that integrated parts, such as functions or modules, interact as expected.
     - Often require more setup and run slower than unit tests since they involve multiple components.

### 2. **Common Testing Patterns**:
   - **Mocking**:
     - Temporarily replaces real objects or functions with "mock" versions.
     - Useful for isolating tests from external dependencies (like databases, APIs) and simulating various responses.
     - Allows testing code behavior without relying on actual external resources.
   - **Parametrization**:
     - Enables testing the same function or scenario with different input values.
     - Reduces repetitive test code and improves test coverage by allowing multiple data points to validate behavior.
     - In Python’s `pytest`, the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator is commonly used for this.
   - **Fixtures**:
     - Provide a consistent and reusable setup environment for tests.
     - Allow setup and teardown of test resources (like databases or configurations) before and after each test or test suite.
     - In `pytest`, fixtures help manage test dependencies efficiently and improve readability by organizing setup code. 

These patterns, when combined, improve test readability, isolation, and reliability, making testing faster and more effective.
